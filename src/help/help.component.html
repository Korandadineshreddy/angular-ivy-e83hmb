                    <p>Notepad is a simple text editor for Microsoft Windows and a basic text-editing program which 
                        enables computer users to create documents. It was first released as a mouse-based MS-DOS program
                        and has been included in all versions of Microsoft Windows since Windows.
                        Notepad is a common text-only (plain text) editor. 
                        The resulting files—typically saved with the .txt extension—have no format tags or styles, making the program suitable for editing system files to use in a DOS environment and, occasionally, source code for later compilation or execution, usually through a command prompt. It is also useful for its negligible use of system resources; making for quick load time and processing time, especially on under-powered hardware. 
                        Notepad supports both left-to-right and right-to-left based languages.
